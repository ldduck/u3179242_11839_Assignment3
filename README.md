 A Voice User Interface(VUI) project for university


### *Note*
*In its current form, the application may read a portion of a word and trigger multiple functions accidently*
*Example: "Reduce" has the word "Red" inside of it, meaning the background colour may change instead of the interface reducing in size. Sometimes both functions may trigger instead.*

## Currently available functions:
**Changing Background Colour:**
You can change the background to the following colours:
- red, blue, green, yellow, purple, organe, pink, black, grey, white

**Maximising and Minimising UI elements to a different style.**
Visual elements can be changed by using sentences with the following words:
- maximise, restore, original, normal, reset, default, increase
- minimise, reduce, decrease, shrink, compact

**Changing the TTS voice to sound masculine or feminine**
If the user would prefer to speak to an alternate voice they can use sentences with the following words:
- male, man, masculine
- female, woman, feminine
